The dataset chosen for this particular task were the reviews obtained from the yelp website.

Correlation test was used for feature selection and feature transformation algorithms, including TFIDF, correlation based feature weighting with sentiment analysis, PCA  and classification algorithms, including Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Perceptrons, SVM, Random forests etc. were employed and the optimal combination was chosen. The final algorithm employed was a combination of Logistic Regression with Naïve Bayes and was able to achieve significantly low RMSE in the out of sample test data and was significantly faster than most of the other algorithms employed.</p>														<p>Our team came 14th out of the 47 teams in class and we also had the second fastest algorithm in the top 15.</p>							 <div align="center"><a href = "http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/fall13/finalfinalleaderboard.html"  class = "btn btn-default ">The final leaderboard</a>							 <a href = "resources\Docs\proj\ML_Project_Report.pdf" class = "btn btn-primary ">More on our algorithm</a>							 </div>		                </div>		            		            </div>		        		        </div>						</div>				<div class = "col-lg-9">		        		            <div class = "panel panel-default">		            		                <div class = "panel-body">		                    <a name="meam"></a>		                    <div class = "page-header">		                        <h3>Intoduction to Robotics Assignments and Projects <small>Posted on January, 20th, 2014</small></h3>		                    </div>		                    		                    <a href=""><img class = "featuredImg" src = "resources\Images\project\meam.jpg" width = "100%"></a>		                    		                    <p>This was an introductory-level course presents the fundamental kinematic, dynamic, and computational principles underlying most modern robotic systems.

We designed and integrated the set up required to reproduce an industrial grade single axis servo motor system. Then the electronics circuit boards were designed and fabricated to enable control of the motor driver via the microcontroller board which was an Arduino UNO. The microcontroller was programmed to enable the following controls, position control using a GUI via the serial port, velocity control with the ability to gradually increase and the acceleration and torque control. Finally a cost analysis was carried out to find out the cost advantage of replacing the PLC with a microcontroller which revealed that the replacement is a highly lucrative option. </p>																<br> 								<a><img class = "featuredImg" src = "resources\Images\project\germany.jpg" width = "100%"></a>								<br>								<h4 align="center">Shift by Wire in Tele-Operated Driving</h4>                                                               								<i>Institute of Automotive Technology, Technische Universitat Munchen, May, 2012 - July, 2012 </i><br>								 <i>Guide: Dipl.-Ing.

My project was to implement "Shift by Wire" functionality in the system. The gear shift was automated with a motor controlled by a microcontroller implementing the CANopen protocol. Communications were carried out via the CAN bus. Push button control was incorporated in case of emergencies which were detected by the loss of heartbeat signals from the Autobox which controls all the actuators of the vehicle.</p>																 								<br><img class = "featuredImg" src = "resources\Images\project\nxt.jpg" width = "100%"> <br>										<h4 align="center">Process Optimization Techniques in Robotics</h4>                                                  																<i>Chemical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, July &December, 2011</i>  <br>								<i>Guide: Dr. Sridharakumar Narasimhan</i>  <br>								<p>The project demonstrated rates of convergence of different optimization techniques. A robot was placed 								in an arena floor having a functional variation of darkness. It was programmed to reach the darkest region of the arena by taking values only around a single point where it is placed. An approximate function was constructed using numerical methods in Matlab and minimized using the first order Steepest Descent and the second order Newton's Optimization algorithm. 								The project was continued in December to study the noise cancellation effects of the weighted least square algorithm on the sensor data and its results were compared with ordinary least square algorithm.</p>																<img class = "featuredImg" src = "resources\Images\project\Ellipse.jpg" width = "100%"> 																<p>The white regions indicate the orientation and the positions where the algorithm worked well whereas yellow and red indicate regions where the algorithm performed poorly.</p>																<div align="center"><a href = "resources\Docs\proj\iitReport.pdf" class = "btn btn-primary ">Project Report</a>								</div>								<br><br>								<h4 align="center">Inplant training </h4>                                                                                                   								<i>Ford Private Ltd, Chennai; BMW Private Ltd, Chennai, July & December, 2010 </i><br>								<p>Obtained practical exposure to various processes involved in the manufacture of an automobile.
