								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>	
										Mapping large environments using mobile ground
										based robots is becoming increasingly popular with the recent
										improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of realtime Simulatenous Localizatin and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. In most
										situations it is lucrative to have multiple robots simultaneously
										map different regions of the environment for faster exploration.
										The most popular algorithm for merging the individual maps
										is the Bundle Adjustment (BA) or the landmark based GraphSLAM. In this project I use
										a simplified offline GraphSLAM algorithm for merging
										the individual 2D maps generated by any number of robots. The
										robots are assumed to have implemented some form of SLAM
										so that in a small region the maps generated are accurate. I utilize scan matching
										with LIDAR sensors and replacing landmark features in the
										BA algorithm with smaller sub maps of the map created by
										each robot. The optimization problem is formulated as a least
										square error minimization by employing a graph structure. The
										optimization in this paper is performed into two parts: (1) the
										correction of the heading angle followed by (2) the correction of
										the X and Y positions of the local maps. The results show that
										though the problem is quadratic in time in the total number
										of smaller sub maps, it produces robust results and therefore
										is a very attractive option.

												<h4>Methodology</h4>
												<ul>
													<li> Merge all the individual robot maps to create a dead reckoning map.
													<img src="resources\Images\project\lir_ims\proj6\im1.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder thumbnail" class = "img-thumbnail" width = "100%" >
													</li>
													<br>
													<li> Combine pose positions together to create submaps for each robot.

													<h4>Problem definition</h4>
													The dataset used in
													this project was obtained from the General Robotics,
													Automation, Sensing and Perception Lab (GRASP) team of
													the University of Pennylvania from the data collected in their
													participation in the Magic 2010 challenge. The competition required
													the participants to design and deploy a team of field
													robots that could explore and map a large dynamic urban
													environment while simultaneously localizing, identifying
													and responding to threats in the environment.
													The data is obtained from five robots exploring different
													regions of the environment with a fair amount of overlap
													in the regions explored. This enables merging of the maps
													using loop-closures (when the robots comes back to the
													same position it has or another robot has been before). The
													robots are equipped with a vertical and a horizontal lidar
													sensor, an IMU and a GPS tracking system. The robots
													performed a highly optimized scan matching technique for
													SLAM, to build a probabilistic grid map.
													The data provided include the poses of the robots in
													the global reference frame including their x,y positions
													and the yaw, pitch and roll angles. Also included is the
													horizontal and the vertical LIDAR hits in the global
													reference frame, along with a specification of which LIDAR
													hit corresponds to an obstacle. This obstacle information
													is important especially in the case of the vertical LIDAR.
													This information could be used to find ditches or pits which
													could otherwise be confused with obstacles. The GPS
													information provided has a low resolution and could not be
													used in the SLAM algorithm with any suitable benefits. For
													the purposes of this project we are only interested in the
													x,y positions and the LIDAR data, other informations are
													irrelevant.

										<ul>
												<li> Try to find if the same part of the map (or close to the same region)is revisited by comparing the submaps. Find the peak
														hough angles for each submap and rotate each pair of submap through the peak hough angles and find the scan matching. If the maximum is above a threshold accept as a loop closure and use the shift from the center in scan matching as a virtual measurement which should correct the initial pose estimates assumed as odometry.

												</li>
												<br>
												<li> Find all the matches in the submaps and plot the graph connections to build the information matrix and the information vector for the angle alone.

												</li>
												<br>
												<li> Now solve the least squares to get all the submaps to the right rotated angles. We can fix the x,y later. This avoids bringing the difficulty of building a covariance matrix which is dependant on x,y and the rotation angle, and making only a variance for the angle.

														</div>
												</li>
												<br>
												<li> Now with the corrected graph and submaps build the information matrix and the information vector for the x,y positions with the covariance matrix. And solve the least square problem to solve the map merging problem and the final log probability map. Do some post processing to make the map look better.
